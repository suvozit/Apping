											<p><strong>Bruce Chia</strong> Bruce Chia is a fourth year 
undergraduate of Computer Science at the National University of 
Singapore. He has a strong interest in developing games in all aspects. 
He specializes in programming but also has a keen eye for colors, a keen
 ear for music and a keen mind for game design. Working on games allows 
him to express his creativity in all areas and never fails to be less 
than an extremely fulfilling experience for him. During his spare time 
at his university, he ran a Game Developer Interest Group and influenced
 the student game developing scene by organizing workshops and 
competitions, including Singapore's very first Contrast Game Design 
competition. He also achieved the Best Technical game in the 2006 
Code-a-thon competition and became the lead programmer for the GAMBIT 
games <i><a href="http://gambit.mit.edu/loadgame/audiodyssey.php">AudiOdyssey</a></i> and <i><a href="http://gambit.mit.edu/loadgame/showtime.php">CarneyVale: Showtime</a></i>. He aspires to one day develop games which would inspire the world, just as other great games have inspired his world.</p>

											<p><strong>William Hutama</strong> started playing games in kindergarten in 1988, when he received a NES console for his birthday, along with <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>  This eventually led him to become a fan of Shigeru Miyamoto, who inspired him to be a game developer.</p>
											
											<p>William graduated from Nanyang Technological University in
 2008 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. He has a strong 
interest in programming and mathematics, and his experience in real 
world programming projects range from writing an AI for chess, to 
participating in a firefighting robot contest with a 16K chip, to 
cognitive autonomous vehicle navigation using neural networks.  Though 
his previous projects were not much related to games, when he joined the
 GAMBIT summer internship programme just after graduation, he got 
hands-on experience in a real game development project. He still 
continues to serve GAMBIT as a game programmer in the Singapore GAMBIT 
Game Lab.</p>
											
											<p>Besides playing games, during his free time and when he 
has extra power after working hours, William explores such game 
programming aspects as graphics (openGL), particle systems, physics, and
 learning to become a rapid game prototyper. He hopes that one day he 
can make epic, fun games that people have never seen before.</p>

											<p><strong>Yeo Jing Ying</strong> graduated from National 
University of Singapore under the Arts and Social Sciences faculty, 
where she became interested in game design and development process 
during her course of study. Upon graduation, she participated in an 
internship with GAMBIT to develop a game prototype as a Game Designer 
within 2 months at Boston. When she returned to Singapore, her first job
 was at Mikoishi Pte Ltd, a game development studio, as a Production 
Assistant for around a year. Currently, she has moved on to work at the 
Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab as an Assistant Producer. She hopes to 
acquire as much experience and knowledge in the games industry as she 
can by learning from and working with the experts and professionals in 
this industry. </p>

program computer games, so he returned to his gamer roots by joining 
Looking Glass Technologies, and then DreamWorks Interactive. Since then,
 Andrew has survived 10 years as a programmer-for-hire and independent 
developer in projects ranging from underwater robotics to yet more 
games. Now, Andrew is the Technical Director for GAMBIT, applying his 
rather eclectic skillset to the wide array of technologies used in the

meaningful fictional universes differently. Matt's non-gaming, non-movie
 related interests are Soviet History and bread.</p>
											
											<p>Matthew did his undergrad at the University of Wisconsin 
in Milwaukee, where he studied film production before going rogue to 
design his own degree. He graduated in 2001 with a degree in Digital 
Arts, which included videogames (this was before Game Studies was a 
field). He continued his videogame research at MIT's Comparative Media 
Studies program where he examined how videogame theory and criticism 
differs between communities. As a CMS grad student he also worked at The
 Education Arcade, most notably collaborating on <cite>Revolution,</cite>
 a small-scale simulation of colonial America. After leaving MIT in 2004
 Matt worked in mobile game development for a few years, occassionally 
doing some consultancy work, before returning to CMS and MIT in 2007 to 
work at the newly created Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab.</p>

											<p>Had you asked <strong>Todd Harper</strong> at age 17 -- a 
music education major at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, 11 year 
euphonium and choir veteran -- if someday he would be a researcher at 
MIT studying games, there's a good chance he'd have laughed at such an 
absurd claim. Yet 15 years and one doctorate later, here he is, a 
postdoctoral researcher at GAMBIT.</p>

<p>After getting his bachelor's degree in Radio/TV/Film at Madison in 
2001, he worked in distance learning and web editing at Indiana State 
University before moving to his hometown of Syracuse for a masters in 
Media Studies at Syracuse University, and then to Ohio University for a 
recently-completed doctorate in Mass Communications. His research 
combines a focus on digital games with an interest in feminist and queer
 theory and popular culture.</p>

<p>When he is not doing actual research on games, Todd spends a good 
deal of time playing them; his favorites tend to be over the top 
fighting games and RPGs that appeal to his campy sense of aesthetics. 
Inspired by the fighting game players he spoke to while working on his 
dissertation, his next goal is to travel to the EVO tournament in 2011, 
learn to use an arcade stick, and still get thoroughly destroyed in the 
first round of the tourney.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.twitter.com/laevantine">follow him on Twitter</a> or read his highly infrequently updated blog, <a href="http://www.chaoticblue.com/blog">Stay Classy</a>.</p>

purpose, and machinima for learning. Past students of Tim's modules have
 presented and published their work at ACM SIGGRAPH Video Games 
Symposium 2008, Los Angeles (recipients of the 2nd best paper award) and
 ISAGA2009, Singapore. Tim's interdisciplinary research interests are in
 design and development for experiential use of technological products 
and digital media. His research in gaming, learning and virtual 
environments focuses on film informing design for experiential and 
contemplative gameplay, development of continuous and unobtrusive 
approach to analyze player's behavior and experience, and using an 
activity theory-based approach to support design of narrative, story and
 gameplay. He's previously held positions in the Integrated Media 
Systems Center (IMSC) at the University of Southern California (USC), 
Los Angeles and at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands.

storytellers to animate their tales, and artists to discover new forms 
of expression. This research employs computer science, mathematics and

machines, and that tools from machine learning and optimal control can 
be used to exploit this coupling when classical control techniques fail.
