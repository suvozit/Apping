<h1> Portfolio </h1>

<p> 
A successful videogame development team requires effective collaboration between 
computer programmers, game designers, instructional designers, user-interface 
designers, graphic artists, animators, sound designers, musicians, voiceover 
artists, playtesters and quality assurance testers. We invite you to write a 
2-page personal essay that: (i) explains your motivation for joining the Human 
Development Lab or Video Games Research Lab, (ii) highlights 2-3 of the above roles that you can 
play in a winning game development team, and (iii) your strengths which make you 
an excellent candidate for the highlighted roles. This essay needs to be 
accompanied by a portfolio that demonstrates compelling evidence of these strengths.
</p>
<p> 
We encourage you to exercise initiative and creativity in deciding what goes 
into your portfolio. We want you to show us how you have previously challenged 
yourself to be the best that you are capable of achieving. If you require 
clarification or additional resources to prepare the strongest possible 
application, you are most welcome to contact Prof. Matthew Kam at
<a href="mailto:mattkam@cs.cmu.edu">mattkam@cs.cmu.edu</a> as early as possible. 
We recognize that some applicants are motivated enough to perform additional 
tasks for your portfolio, and we can provide such tasks as &#8220;extra credit.&#8221;&nbsp;
</p>
<p> 
The personal essay should be submitted as a PDF document. The portfolio can take 
the form of email attachments or URLs. It is a good idea to ensure that your 
name and email address can be found in each PDF, applet and source code. You 
should submit your application as a single email, i.e. please don't confuse us 
by breaking up your application into multiple emails.</p>
<p> 
Just to give you a sense of what a solid portfolio entails... It can include 
work that you have done for a highly-challenging class assignment, or work that you 
submitted as entries to major competitions. Tell us about how you 
approached these tasks and your thought process. For example, if you want to 
demonstrate your talents in graphics design, let us see artwork and animations 
that you have previously developed, and let us know what software you used to 
create them. Help us to understand the options that you considered and the rationale for the design decisions that 
you made.</p>
<p> 
As another example, if you plan to impress us with your programming skills, let 
us look at the source code and working implementations of the applications you 
have developed. For the latter, you can either upload the application online as 
a web applet and let us have the URL, or email us the applet in a way that is 
easy for us to run. Your applications should be developed in a serious 
programming language such as Java or C/C++/C#, as opposed to a scripting 
language. The ideal applications would reflect a good understanding of how to 
write applications that perform reasonably well in real-time on low-resource 
devices, which may include good memory management practices, 8-bit assembly 
language programming, and performance optimization.
</p>
<p> 
Submissions will be evaluated based on their quality, attention to detail, and 
ability to communicate well in writing. For example, we will review your source 
code to see that you have employed good programming practices, such that your 
code does not hard-code anything, is easy to maintain and is easy to read. Your 
binary implementations should run smoothly without bugs or memory overflows. We 
will expect you to be proud enough about your prior prototypes and their 
user-interfaces to show them to a job interviewer. Other important 
user-interface considerations include having (i) a consistent look-and-feel 
across multiple screens, as well as (ii) menus and navigation options that are 
intuitive and easy to locate. Demonstrating maturity when communicating with us 
over email will ensure your submission receive a more thorough review. On the 
whole, we expect your submissions to convey a strong, positive impression about 
your work ethic and you as a decent human being.</p>

<p><span class="style1">Important note on plagiarism</span>: The portfolio that 
you submit should be your own work, i.e. do not copy work from elsewhere that 
someone else did. If you are showing us work that you did with other project 
team members, you have an ethical obligation to clearly specify what your 
individual contributions were.</p>
