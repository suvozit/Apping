<p style="font-size:80%">I am Anuj Kumar, a second year Ph.D. student in
 the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon 
University. My advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Emattkam/" target="_blank">Matthew Kam</a>.
 My primary research direction is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and 
specific interests include mobile interfaces, speech recognition 
algorithms and applications, education/learning technology, machine 
learning and its applications in HCI, and novel input and interaction 
techniques. Together with my advisor, I'm building the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Emattkam/lab/index.html" target="_blank">Human Development Lab</a> at CMU HCII. <br><br><b>Contact: </b><br> 5000, Forbes Avenue, HCII, CMU, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213 <br>Email: anujkumar ATsign cmu DOT edu</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Arial; color:#9DD52A">Selected Research</h3>
<p style="font-size:80%"> <b>SMART: Speech-enabled Mobile Assisted Reading Technology</b><br>Project
 SMART is an inter-disciplinary research project at Carnegie Mellon 
University that aims to improve reading skills for early-age second 
language learners, both in the United States and the developing world, 
such as India. Using games on mobile phones, SMART applications give 
ample practice opportunities to children to read aloud, thereby 
scaffolding there ability to understand written text. SMART applications
 also use speech-recognition on mobile devices to understand children's 
speech and give appropriate feedback, whenever necessary. Learning how 
to read and understand text in a new language is time and practice 
intensive; thus SMART applications enable children to practice both 
inside and outside regular school hours, thereby gaining additional 
exposure at convenient times. </p>
<p style="font-size:80%"> <b>MILLEE: Mobile and Immersive Learning for Literacy in Emerging Economies</b> (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Emattkam/lab/millee.html" target="_blank">website</a>)<br>MILLEE
 aims to design and develop applications on low-cost, affordable mobile 
phones that enable children in the developing world to acquire literacy 
skills in immersive, game-like environments. We aim to target localized 
language learning needs and to make the digital literacy resources more 
available to children at times and places that are more convenient than 
schools. Our design methodology draws strength from contextual 
interviews with school teachers, children, and parents; as well as 
inspirations from traditional village games that children play and enjoy
 most.</p>
