        <p>Questions 1-9<br>
		In 1972, a century after the first national park in the United States 
		was established at <br>
		Yellowstone, legislation was passed to create the National Marine 
		Sanctuaries Program.<br>
		The intent of this legislation was to provide protection to selected 
		coastal habitats similar <br>
		To that existing for land areas designated as national parks. The 
		designation of an areas <br>
		5) a marine sanctuary indicates that it is a protected area, just as a 
		national park is. People <br>
		are permitted to visit and observe there, but living organisms and their 
		environments may <br>
		not be harmed or removed. </p>
		<p>The National Marine Sanctuaries Program is administered by the 
		National Oceanic <br>
		and Atmospheric Administration, a branch of the United States Department 
		of Commerce. <br>
		10) Initially, 70 sites were proposed as candidates for sanctuary 
		status. Two and a half decades <br>
		later, only fifteen sanctuaries had been designated, with half of these 
		established after <br>
		1978. They range in size from the very small (less than I square 
		kilometer) Fagatele Bay<br>
		National Marine Sanctuary in American Samoa to the Monterey Bay National 
		Marine<br>
		Sanctuary in California, extending over 15,744 square kilometers. </p>
		<p>15) The National Marine Sanctuaries Program is a crucial part of new 
		management <br>
		practices in which whole communities of species, and not just individual 
		species, are <br>
		offered some degree of protection from habitat degradation and 
		overexploitation. Only <br>
		in this way can a reasonable degree of marine species diversity be 
		maintained in a setting <br>
		that also maintains the natural interrelationships that exist among 
		these species. <br>
		20) Several other types of marine protected areas exist in the United 
		States and other <br>
		countries. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System, managed by 
		the United <br>
		States government, includes 23 designated and protected estuaries. 
		Outside the United <br>
		States, marine protected-area programs exist as marine parks, reserves, 
		and preserves. <br>
		Over 100 designated areas exist around the periphery of the Carbbean 
		Sea. Others range<br>
		25) from the well-known Australian Great Barrer Reef Marine Park to 
		lesser-known parks <br>
		in countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, where tourism is placing 
		growing pressures <br>
		on fragile coral reef systems. As state, national, and international 
		agencies come to <br>
		recognize the importance of conserving marine biodiversity, marine 
		projected areas. <br>
		whether as sanctuaries, parks, or estuarine reserves, will play an 
		increasingly important <br>
		role in preserving that diversity. <br>
		<br>
		1. What does the passage mainly discuss? <br>
		(A) Differences among marine parks, sanctuaries, and reserves <br>
		(B) Various marine conservation programs <br>
		(C) International agreements on coastal protection <br>
		&nbsp;(D) Similarities between land and sea protected environments <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		2. The word &#8220;intent&#8221; in line 3 is closest in meaning to <br>
		(A) repetition <br>
		(B) approval <br>
		(C) goal<br>
		(D) revision </p>
		<p>3. The word &#8220;administered&#8221; in line 8 is closest in meaning to <br>
		(A) managed <br>
		(B) recognized <br>
		(C) opposed <br>
		(D) justified <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		4. The word &#8220;these&#8221; in line 11 refers to <br>
		(A) sites <br>
		(B) candidates <br>
		(C) decades <br>
		(D) sanctuaries <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		5. The passage mentions the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary 
		(lines 13-14) as an<br>
		example of a sanctuary that <br>
		(A) is not well know <br>

		Questions 10-17<br>
		From their inception, most rural neighborhoods in colonial North America 
		included<br>
		at least one carpenter, joiner, sawyer, and cooper in woodworking; a 
		weaver and a tailor &nbsp;<br>
		for clothing production; a tanner, currier, and cordwainer (shoemaker) 
		for fabricating leather<br>
		objects; and a blacksmith for metalwork, Where stone was the local 
		building material, a <br>
		5) mason was sure to appear on the list of people who paid taxes. With 
		only an apprentice as <br>
		an assistant, the rural artisan provided the neighborhood with common 
		goods from furniture <br>
		to shoes to farm equipment in exchange for cash or for &#8220;goods in kind&#8221; 
		from the customer&#8217;s <br>
		field, pasture, or dairy. Sometimes artisans transformed material 
		provided by the customer <br>
		wove cloth of yam spun at the farm from the wool of the family sheep; 
		made chairs or tables<br>
		10) from wood cut in the customer&#8217;s own woodlot; produced shoes or 
		leather breeches from <br>
		cow, deer, or sheepskin tanned on the farm.<br>
		Like their farming neighbors, rural artisans were part of an economy 
		seen, by one <br>
		historian, as &#8220;an orchestra conducted by nature.&#8221; Some tasks could not 
		be done in the winter, <br>
		other had to be put off during harvest time, and still others waited on 
		raw materials that were <br>
		15) only produced seasonally. As the days grew shorter, shop hours kept 
		pace, since few artisans <br>
		could afford enough artificial light to continue work when the Sun went 
		down. To the best <br>
		of their ability, colonial artisans tried to keep their shops as 
		efficient as possible and to <br>
		regularize their schedules and methods of production for the best return 
		on their investment <br>
		in time, tools, and materials, While it is pleasant to imagine a 
		woodworker, for example, <br>
		20) carefully matching lumber, joining a chest together without resort 
		to nails or glue, and <br>
		applying all thought and energy to carving beautiful designs on the 
		finished piece, the time <br>
		required was not justified unless the customer was willing to pay extra 
		for the quality&#8212;<br>
		and few in rural areas were, Artisans, therefore, often found it 
		necessary to employ as <br>
		many shortcuts and economics as possible while still producing 
		satisfactory products. <br>

		Questions 18-28<br>
		Cities develop as a result of functions that they can perform. Some 
		functions result<br>
		directly from the ingenuity of the citizenry, but most functions result 
		from the needs of <br>
		the local area and of the surrounding hinterland (the region that 
		supplies goods to the<br>
		city and to which the city furnishes services and other goods). 
		Geographers often make <br>
		5) a distinction between the situation and the site of a city. Situation 
		refers to the general <br>
		position in relation to the surrounding region, whereas site involves 
		physical <br>
		characteristics of the specific location. Situation is normally much 
		more important to <br>
		the continuing prosperity of a city. if a city is well situated in 
		regard to its hinterland, its<br>
		development is much more likely to continue. Chicago, for example, 
		possesses an almost <br>
		10) unparalleled situation: it is located at the southern end of a huge 
		lake that forces east-west<br>
		transportation lines to be compressed into its vicinity, and at a 
		meeting of significant land <br>
		and water transport routes. It also overlooks what is one of the world&#8217;s 
		finest large <br>
		farming regions. These factors ensured that Chicago would become a great 
		city regardless <br>
		of the disadvantageous characteristics of the available site, such as 
		being prone to flooding <br>
		15) during thunderstorm activity. <br>
		Similarly, it can be argued that much of New York City&#8217;s importance 
		stems from its <br>
		early and continuing advantage of situation. Philadephia and Boston both 
		originated at <br>
		about the same time as New York and shared New York&#8217;s location at the 
		western end of <br>
		one of the world&#8217;s most important oceanic trade routes, but only New 
		York possesses an<br>
		20) easy-access functional connection (the Hudson-Mohawk lowland) to the 
		vast Midwestern <br>
		hinterland. This account does not alone explain New York&#8217;s primacy, but 
		it does include <br>
		several important factors. Among the many aspects of situation that help 
		to explain why <br>
		some cities grow and others do not, original location on a navigable 
		waterway seems <br>
		particularly applicable. Of course, such characteristic as slope, 
		drainage, power <br>
		25) resources, river crossings, coastal shapes, and other physical 
		characteristics help to <br>
		determine city location, but such factors are normally more significant 
		in early stages <br>
		of city development than later. &nbsp;<br>
		<br>

		Questions 29-10<br>
		The largest of the giant gas planets, Jupiter, with a volume 1,300 times 
		greater than<br>
		Earth&#8217;s, contains more than twice the mass of all the other planets 
		combined. It is thought <br>
		to be a gaseous and fluid planet without solid surfaces, Had it been 
		somewhat more massive, <br>
		Jupiter might have attained internal temperatures as high as the 
		ignition point for nuclear <br>
		5) reactions, and it would have flamed as a star in its own right. 
		Jupiter and the other giant <br>
		planets are of a low-density type quite distinct from the terrestrial 
		planets: they are<br>
		composed predominantly of such substances as hydrogen, helium, ammonia, 
		and methane, <br>
		unlike terrestrial planets. Much of Jupiter&#8217;s interior might be in the 
		form of liquid, metallic <br>
		hydrogen, Normally, hydrogen is a gas, but under pressures of millions 
		of kilograms per <br>
		10) square centimeter, which exist in the deep interior of Jupiter, the 
		hydrogen atoms might <br>
		lock together to form a liquid with the properties of a metal. Some 
		scientists believe that <br>
		the innermost core of Jupiter might be rocky, or metallic like the core 
		of Earth. <br>
		Jupiter rotates very fast, once every 9.8 hours. As a result, its 
		clouds, which are composed <br>
		&nbsp;largely of frozen and liquid ammonia, have been whipped into 
		alternating dark and bright <br>
		15) bands that circle the planet at different speeds in different 
		latitudes. Jupiter&#8217;s puzzling<br>
		Great Red Spot changes size as it hovers in the Southern Hemisphere. 
		Scientists speculate<br>
		it might be a gigantic hurricane, which because of its large size (the 
		Earth could easily fit <br>
		inside it), lasts for hundreds of years. <br>
		Jupiter gives off twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun. 
		Perhaps this is primeval <br>
		20) heat or beat generated by the continued gravitational contraction of 
		the planet. Another <br>
		starlike characteristic of Jupiter is its sixteen natural satellites, 
		which, like a miniature model <br>
		of the Solar System, decrease in density with distance&#8212;from rocky moons 
		close to Jupiter <br>
		to icy moons farther away. If Jupiter were about 70 times more massive, 
		it would have<br>
		become a star, Jupiter is the best-preserved sample of the early solar 
		nebula, and with its <br>
		satellites, might contain the most important clues about the origin of 
		the Solar System. <br>

		&nbsp;Questions 41-50<br>
		The tern &#8220;art deco&#8221; has come to encompass three distinct but related 
		design trends<br>
		of the 1920&#8217;s and 1930&#8217;s. The first was what is frequently referred to 
		as &#8220;zigzag<br>
		moderne&#8221; &#8211;the exotically ornamental style of such skyscrapers as the 
		Chrysler Building <br>
		in New York City and related structures such as the Paramount Theater in 
		Oakland,<br>
		5) California The word &#8220;zigzag&#8221; alludes to the geometric and stylized 
		ornamentation of <br>
		zigzags, angular patterns, abstracted plant and animal motifs, 
		sunbursts, astrological <br>
		imagery, formalized fountains, and related themes that were applied in 
		mosaic relief. <br>
		and mural form to the exterior and interior of the buildings. Many of 
		these buildings were <br>
		shaped in the ziggurat form, a design resembling an ancient Mesopotamian 
		temple tower <br>
		10) that recedes in progressively smaller stages to the summit, creating 
		a staircase-like effect. <br>
		The second manifestation of art deco was the 1930&#8217;s streamlined moderne&#8221; 
		style&#8212;a <br>
		Futuristic-looking aerodynamic style of rounded corners and horizontal 
		bands known as<br>
		&#8220;speed stripes.&#8221; In architecture, these elements were frequently 
		accompanied by round <br>
		windows, extensive use of glass block, and flat rooftops. <br>
		15) The third style, referred to as cither &#8220; international stripped 
		classicism,&#8221; or simply <br>
		&#8220; classical moderne,&#8221; also came to the forefront during the Depression, 
		a period of severe<br>
		economic difficult in the 1930&#8217;s. This was amore conservative style, 
		blending a <br>
		simplified modernistic style with a more austere form of geometric and 
		stylized relief <br>
		sculpture and other ornament, including interior murals. May buildings 
		in this style<br>
		20) were erected nationwide through government programs during the 
		Depression .<br>
		Although art deco in its many forms was largely perceived as thoroughly 
		modern, <br>
		it was strongly influenced by the decorative arts movements that 
		immediately preceded <br>
		it. For example, like &#8220;art nouveau&#8221; (1890-1910), art deco also used 
		plant motifs, but<br>
		regularized the forms into abstracted repetitive patterns rather than 
		presenting them as <br>
		25) flowing, asymmetrical foliage, Like the Viennese craftspeople of the 
		Wiener Werkstatte,<br>
		art deco designers worked with exotic materials, geometricized shapes, 
		and colorfully<br>
		ornate patterns. Furthermore, like the artisans of the Arts and Crafts 
		Movement in England <br>
		and the United States, art deep practitioners considered it their 
		mission to transform the <br>
		domestic environment through well-designed furniture and household 
		accessories. <br>
