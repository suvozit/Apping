<p>This page contains the Issue topics for the Analytical Writing 
section of the GREÂ® revised General Test. When you take the test, you 
will be presented with one Issue topic from this pool.</p>

<p>Each Issue topic consists of an issue statement or statements 
followed by specific task instructions that tell you how to respond to 
the issue. The wording of some topics in the test might vary slightly 
from what is presented here. Also, because there may be multiple 
versions of some topics with similar or identical wording but with 
different task instructions, it is very important to read your test 
topic and its specific task directions carefully and respond to the 
wording as it appears in the actual test.</p>
